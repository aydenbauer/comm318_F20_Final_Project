## Data Analysis for Final Project

In this folder I analyze data taken fromo Google Trends and the CDC. In this document I will explain what each nootebook aims to do!

## Notebooks

Netflix Analysis Year Comparison - This notebook compares Netflix's seach trends from three separate years to establish whether or not there is usually a certain pattern the popularity follows or if it was always different. I was able too plot the trend lines for three years and then compare them on the same graphs for a better visual. I also include comparisons for Netflix and the popular movie theater chain AMC to see the relationship between the two. 

Netflix Map Analysis - This notebook consists of data from Google Trends. I start off plotting Netflix's 2020 popularity search trends and then break it down by state. I then took the top three states and compared their search trends to each other and to the national search trend to see if they were all similar and if they all showed effects of the pandemic. I included information about when each state went into lockdown and shut essential businesses which would mean people were spending more time indoors. 

COVID-19 Data by State - This notetbook builds off of the previous one (Netflix Map Analysis) and looks at the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases for each state and compare that data with their respective Netflix data. 


Netflix Shows Data - This notebook includes datasets from Google Trends that show the trendlines for Netflix's search popularity in the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 year. I also created dataframes from secondary reasearch that includes Netflix's popular releases from the respective years. I then mapped these shows and their airdates on the trend timeline so that I could analyze and determine if there was a relationship between popularity and new releases.
