## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

I created a blog post that discusses Netflix's popularity during the pandemic. I decided to look into this becuase like so many others, my family gathered every night in the beginning of the quarantine to watch something together. When the pandemic first started and stay-at-home orders were enaccted, many people turned to television for comfort. I deccided to look at Netflix over other streaming services because Netflix has programs for people of all ages and is constantly releasing original content. 

My own experiences and some preliminary research led me to my main research question which was whether or not COVID-19 affected Netflix's popularity. I decided to use Google Trends to measure this as Google has over 75% of the search engine market share and searching for Netflix was the best indiciator for popularity. I considered using Netflix sign-ups as a measure hoowever ultimately decided against it because people there are many people who had accounts proir to the pandemic that could contribute to the popularity trends. 

I included data from previous years to compare to this past year so that I could confidently claim that trends this past year were unusual. After establishing a relationship between COVID-19 and Netflix's popularity, I dug deeper and explored indiviudal states' trends for both Netflix searches and their COVID-19 weekly cases. I found a dataset from the CDC that broke information down by state and then new weekly cases among other things. I chose to focus on the new weekly cases versus days or months because the Google Trends data is broken down by week so thiis allowed the data to be more compatible. 

After analyzing these relationships and trends, I read an interesting article that proposed a new idea about streaming service trends having to do with new releases so I added onto my initial research. I did secondary research to find some of Netflix's most popular show releases in over the past couple of years and then mapped them on the Netflix trend maps to see if there were any relationships. 

Due to the nature of Google Trends, my data had no need for cleaning and was straight forward. Each of the notebooks in my data_analysis folder follow a different investigation and provide clear evidence and analysis.
